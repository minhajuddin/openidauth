    3 A few random images are sent to the client
    4 The user selects 3 images and enters 3 pass phrases
    5 This info is sent to the server after hashing and the server stores it

* Changed process
==Registration==
D 1 Check availability of user id by sending the # of user id   
  2 Server randomly picks a few images and sends them to the client
  3 Client enters the password and the "client scripts" send the Pwdi =>(#((Pwd1 + Pwd2 + Pwd3) + ID))
  4 The server computes:
              Mi = #(#(ID) xor Kx)      * Kx is a secret key of the server
              Vi = Mi xor Pwdi
  5 The server sends the a file with the value of Vi to the client
  
== Login ==
  1 Client browses to the login page
  2 Client enters his ID
      "Client scripts" compute:
          - Ri = #(ID) xor #(Ks1)     * Ks1 is a random number
       Ri, Ks1 are sent to the server
  3 Server extracts #(ID) => (Ri xor #(Ks1))
  4 Server asks for the location of the file (smartcard)
